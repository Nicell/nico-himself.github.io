### Introduction:

QGSS 2023 is a dynamic two-week program aiming to empower future quantum researchers and developers. This fourth-annual summer school takes a fundamental approach, focusing on the core concepts of quantum computing and bridging the gap between theory and real-world application. I'm prepared to enhance my skills, refresh my perspective, and unlock new horizons!

Stay tuned as I will update this post as I work my way through the two-week course.
